# E-commerce Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering in R

This project aims to demonstrate how to perform customer segmentation in an e-commerce dataset using K-means clustering algorithm in R. Customer segmentation is a valuable technique in e-commerce as it helps businesses understand their customers better, tailor marketing strategies, and optimize their offerings based on different customer segments.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers' purchasing behavior, such as transaction history, purchase frequency, and monetary value. The dataset was preprocessed, transformed and cleaned, before performing analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

1. R programming language (version 4.2.1)
2. RStudio or any other R integrated development environment (IDE)
3. Required R packages: `cluster`, `tidyverse`, `factoextra`, `corrplot`, `GGally`

library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
library(GGally)

## Installation
To install the required R packages, you can use the following commands in your R environment:

```R
install.packages("cluster")
install.packages("factoextra")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("corrplot")
install.packages("GGally")
```

## Usage
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R script file `customer_segmentation.R` in RStudio or your preferred R IDE.
3. Set the working directory to the project folder where the script file is located.
4. Run the script step-by-step or all at once to see the results.

## Methodology
1. Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
2. Preprocess the data by transforming, scaling, or normalizing variables if required.
3. Perform K-means clustering on the preprocessed dataset using the `kmeans()` function from the `cluster` package.
4. Determine the optimal number of clusters using elbow method or silhouette analysis.
5. Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots, bar charts, or other relevant visualizations.

## Results
The project will provide insights into customer segmentation, including:

1. Visualizations of customer clusters.
2. Interpretation of the customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.
3. Evaluation of the clustering solution using internal validation measures.

## Conclusion
By utilizing K-means clustering in R, this project demonstrates how e-commerce businesses can effectively segment their customers based on their purchasing behavior. The identified customer segments can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and improve customer satisfaction.
